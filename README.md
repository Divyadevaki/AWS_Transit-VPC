Documentation for Creating Transit VPC Setup

📝Transit Gateway
-> Transit Gateway in AWS is used to connect multiple VPC connections together
-> It acts like a central hub to connect multiple VPC.
-> Transit Gateway simplifies the network management for large-scale environments by centralizing connectivity.
-> TGW routes traffic between all attached VPCs and on-premises networks automatically.
-> Instead of creating peering connections between every VPC (which becomes more complex when number VPC increased), TGW is best option for large-scale environment.
