üìùTransit Gateway
‚Ä¢	Implementing Three-Tier design that separates Web-Tier, App-Tier and DB-Tier using EC2, ALB.

‚Ä¢	Transit Gateway in AWS is used to connect multiple VPC connections together

‚Ä¢ It acts like a central hub to connect multiple VPC.

‚Ä¢ Transit Gateway simplifies the network management for large-scale environments by centralizing connectivity.

‚Ä¢ TGW routes traffic between all attached VPCs and on-premises networks automatically.

‚Ä¢ Instead of creating peering connections between every VPC (which becomes more complex when number VPC increased), TGW is best option for large-scale environment.
